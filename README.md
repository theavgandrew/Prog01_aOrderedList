# Prog01_aOrderedList
The Problem
While Java offers a rich suite of library classes and methods, there are times when we need to create our
own specialized classes so that we can control the way data is maintained and accessed (for security
purposes, for example) or to support domain-specific performance requirements.

We are going to develop a custom class for use in our private library that will support an ordered list of
objects. This programming assignment is phase 1 of a multi-phase project to customize our
aOrderedList class. Future phases will modify and extend the accomplishments of this phase.
The Solution: Phase 1
Phase 1 functionality will be achieved in a series of steps. It is strongly suggested that you complete one
step before progressing to the next step.
